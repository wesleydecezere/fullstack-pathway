# fullstack-pathway
My learning pathway to becoming a full stack developer.


#### Cicle to follow until finish each short course or course module 
1. make the directory
2. inclued a .md, briefly describing the subject and writing the topics which will be study
3. find some way to take notes and run code, like .md file + vscode or a jupyter notebook, and commit at least each study section 
4. at finishing the classes and exercices, review the content produced and take notes in the first .md, about the topics learned or any other intersting point
