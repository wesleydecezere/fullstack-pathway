# fullstack-pathway
My learning pathway to becoming a full stack developer.


#### Cycle to follow until finish each short course or course module 
1. make the course/module directory

   * set a remote git origin, pointing to the author's course repo

   * clone the author's course repo , naming it as 'ref-repo'

2. include a readme.md in the root, briefly describing the subject and writing the topics which will be study
3. find some way to take notes and run code, like .md file + vs-code or a jupyter notebook, and commit at least each study section 
   * use/edit author's notes to follow the video lesson
   * include new files, to make my own notes and to do the proposed exercises, when available  
4. at finishing the all classes and exercises, review the content produced and take notes in the first .md, about the topics learned or any other interesting point
